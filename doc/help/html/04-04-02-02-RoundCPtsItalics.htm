<h1><a name=xql54o></a><a name=19x3ztf></a>Rounding Control Points on Italics</h1>

<p>When the control point has to give way (to comply with the rounding), you
may want it to do so not in parallel to the grid line, but parallel (Y
direction) or perpendicular (X direction) to the main stroke angle of the
italic glyph you’re hinting. You can do so by changing the rounding methods on
the control points of the italic glyphs.</p>

<p>You can change the rounding method of any control point while linking, interpolating,
or shifting it. Just hold down the Shift key as you click the control point
with the hinting tool. Visual TrueType displays the menu for rounding methods
(for details, see <a href="../../html_combined/vtt3faa.htm">Rounding Control
Points</a>).</p>

<p>For italics, you choose rounding methods from the middle and bottom rows of
the menu: </p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
middle row specifies rounding in relation to the main stroke angle you measured
for the glyph: <br>
<img border=0 width=195 height=39 alt="Middle row of rounding methods"
src="../images/bm146.gif"></p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
bottom row specifies rounding in relation to the adjusted italic angle, which
is the main stroke angle but adjusted to cross the baseline and the cap height
at a pixel boundary:<br>
<img border=0 width=195 height=39 alt="Middle row of rounding methods"
src="../images/bm146.gif"></p>

<p>Use this row when the diagonal strokes of the italic glyphs have an
unattractive and distracting stair-step pattern.</p>

<p>However, rounding may not offer the subtle adjustments you need to correct
every stair-step pattern. Sometimes, you may want to use the XMove and YMove
tools. Both tools can move control points slightly off the grid (for example,
one-fourth pixel), which isn’t possible by simple rounding. For details about
using the XMove and YMove tools, see “Refining Pixel Patterns.”</p>

<p><b>Note</b> The move tools shift a control point a set number of pixels, and
the adjustment applies to all sizes of the glyph.</p>
