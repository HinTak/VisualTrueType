<h1><a name=8m3xr9></a>Using the Control Value Table</h1>

<p>Every TrueType font uses a control value table (‘cvt’) of key values in the
font. Each entry in the table gives the value for the dominant width, length,
or angle of a group of features, such as the stem width or the serif length.
Some control values are specific to certain glyphs, but others apply to the
entire font.</p>

<p>To ensure consistency, your hints—anchors, links, and strokes—can refer to
these key values. If you later change a value entered in the ‘cvt’ table,
Visual TrueType updates all anchors, links, and strokes that refer to that
‘cvt’ entry.</p>

<p>The text-based control value table displays in its own window. When you
prepare the font, the window opens automatically (see “Preparing the Open
Font”). Before hinting, you need to fill in a template provided by Visual
TrueType, described next. </p>

<p>After filling in the template, you may want to leave the window open.
Otherwise, close it and open it again as needed. For example, you need to
update a ‘cvt’ entry for italic glyphs (see the “Hinting diagonal strokes,” and
“Hinting italic glyphs sections”). In addition, advanced users might want to
review the ‘cvt’ entries to determine which values would be most appropriate
for the anchors, links, and strokes. In addition, you might want to add other
‘cvt’ entries (for details, see “Modifying the ‘Cvt’ Table”).</p>
