<h1><a name=4363uv5></a>Creating Links</h1>

<p>A link connects two control points over a flexible distance. It starts at a
point (the “parent”) and ends at a second point (the “child”). The link doesn’t
affect the parent point, but it determines the location of the child in
relation to the parent.</p>

<p>More than one link can start from the same point. In addition, what was the
second control point (“child”) in one link may be the first control point
(“parent”) for another link. In fact, you can create a chain of connected
links, each entailing the next, as long as the last control point in the chain
is not a parent point earlier in the chain<b>.</b></p>

<p>Links go in one direction, so the toolbar has two linking tools—one for the
X direction and one for the Y direction:</p>

<p><img width=104 height=80 alt="X Link tool icon"
src="../images/Toolbar-XLink.png"><img width=104 height=80
alt="Y Link tool icon" src="../images/Toolbar-YLink.png"></p>

<p>The respective tool will be available only if the Show X Direction or Show Y
Direction options are selected in the Display Options dialog found on the
Display menu. Similarly, Visual TrueType displays links only for the selected
direction(s).</p>

<p>Selecting a link tool changes the cursor into a horizontal or vertical arrow
for the X or Y direction:</p>

<p><img width=40 height=37 alt="X Link Cursor"
src="../images/Cursor-XLink.png"><img width=34 height=37
alt="Y Link Cursor" src="../images/Cursor-YLink.png"></p>

<p>To create the link, you drag from one point to another. The link controls
the child point in either the X or Y direction, based on the link tool you use.
The link looks like an arrow filled with lines. Both the lines and the
arrowhead parallel the X or Y direction of the link. Horizontal and vertical
links will be straight, but diagonal links will curve.</p>

<p><b>Tip</b> A good strategy is to create links on the glyph outline before
you display pixels.</p>

<p>If you have not previously rounded the linked control points, Visual
TrueType automatically rounds them for you. By default, Visual TrueType rounds
to the nearest grid line (X or Y, depending on the direction of the link). If
you want a different rounding method, you can specify another (for details, see
“Rounding Control Points”).</p>

<p>The distance, at least one pixel, must be a whole number of pixels (rounded
to the grid at the current ppem size) as specified in the ‘cvt’ table. As a
result, if the parent point is controlled to a grid boundary, the link also
grid-fits the child because you usually want it a whole number of pixels from
the parent.</p>

<p>By default, the shape of the arrowhead reflects the last-selected option
relating links to control values. In addition, the link might display a small
highway sign, with or without a number. For details about both variations, see
“Linking with ‘Cvt’ Values” in this chapter.</p>

<p>X links typically start at the side-bearing points. You’ll use links most
often to control side bearings (X direction only) and stem thickness (X and Y
directions). For other uses, see “Advanced Hinting.”</p>

<p>Links are flexible. For example, you can change the link by making a different
control point the “parent” or “child.” At any time, you can delete the link. </p>

<p><b>Tip</b> When you’re not working with links, you can hide them to make
more room on the screen for other visual hinting. In the Display Options
dialog, you can set the Links and Dists option to show or hide Link commands.</p>

<p>To create Links via the keyboard, you must type the appropriate VTT Talk
commands into the VTT Talk window (Ctrl + 5).</p>
