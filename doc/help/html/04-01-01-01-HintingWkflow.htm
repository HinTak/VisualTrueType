<h1><a name=15rn3on></a>Hinting with Visual TrueType: A General Workflow</h1>

<p>Hinting is a subjective and complex art. You’ve developed your own approach
to hinting, work habits that you can continue with Visual TrueType. This user
guide introduces hinting tasks in a typical order that you can follow or not,
based on your experience and the font itself. In general, you should:</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Review
the glyph and, if necessary, add, remove, and adjust existing control points.
Hinting is about controlling points on the glyph outline. You control points in
relation to points already hinted or in relation to some absolute X or Y value
from the origin. </p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Hint
in the Y direction, then hint in the X direction. The X and Y axes are
independent for hinting except for diagonals and italics. Visual TrueType can
limit its display to only Y hints or only X hints, so you don’t become
confused.</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Link
control points before you interpolate between them. Linking creates
relationships between two or more points. Interpolating maintains the relative
position of one or more linked points between the first and last points in the
same link.</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Do
all global hinting before adding local hints to create exceptions. These local
hints fine-tune hinting on a glyph by moving a single control point by a
specific distance at a single ppem size.</p>
