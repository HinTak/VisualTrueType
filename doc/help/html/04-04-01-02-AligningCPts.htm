<h1><a name=1oial6w></a>Aligning Control Points</h1>

<p>What looks like a straight row of control points might become distorted by
hinting applied to the various points. However, you may need to keep the points
on the same line.</p>

<p>To align three or more points, you can control them with the Align tool.
Aligning is similar to interpolating in that you align one or more “child”
points between two “parent” points.</p>

<p>Because aligns don’t have an X or Y direction, you create all aligns with
one tool:</p>

<p><img width=104 height=80 alt="Align tool icon"

<p>When you select the Align tool, the pointer changes to two diagonal
arrowheads:</p>

<p><img width=37 height=37 alt="Align tool cursor"
src="../images/Cursor-Align.png"></p>

<p>First you drag from one parent control point to the other. A black arrow
appears, with a rounded tail at each parent point. The arrow is flexible, like
a rubber band. When you drag the arrow (avoiding the tail or arrowhead) onto a
point that’s between the parents, the original arrow divides. Both arrows end
in rounded-tip arrowheads at the child point.</p>

<p>If another point is to be aligned with these, drag either arrow onto the
point, and the pair of arrows becomes a chain of arrows connecting all the
points to be aligned. You can align any number of points.</p>

<p>Zooming in will help you see the control points you’re trying to align. If
the arrow hides a control point you want to align, drag the arrow away until
you can see the point, then drag it back onto the point. </p>

<p>To delete an Align, drag the rounded-tip arrowhead off each child point.
When you do this for the last remaining child point, the arrow disappears.</p>

<p><b>Tip</b> When you’re not working with aligns, you can hide them to make
more room on the screen for other visual hinting. In the Display Options
dialog, you can set the Aligns option to show or hide Align commands.</p>
