<h1><a name=bvrkap></a>Hinting Strategies</h1>

<p>In general, the more detailed hinting you do to a font, the better the
quality of the font. Some outline editors automatically hint a font for you.
Although auto-hinting sometimes is better than none at all, Visual TrueType
offers more sophisticated controls for those people interested in crafting
high-quality fonts that will display and print reliably on all devices. For
this reason, Visual TrueType can strip all auto-hinting from your font so you
add more and better hints. For details, see “Preparing the Open Font” in
Chapter 3, “Using Visual TrueType: The Basics.”</p>

<p>You hint all glyphs in a font, one glyph at a time. Hints applied to a glyph
apply to all sizes of that glyph. Consequently, you need to visually inspect a
range of sizes, both smaller and larger, to verify that the hinting makes all
sizes look good. </p>

<p>When hinting, staying true to the outline becomes less important than
producing a clear bitmap at smaller point sizes, particularly on low-resolution
output devices. Your main concerns are choosing key features to maintain in the
glyphs and ensuring that features similar or identical on different glyphs
remain so at different sizes. You should try to:</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Maintain
consistent heights (cap height, x-height, ascenders, descenders, and so on).</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Keep
stroke weights consistent.</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Prevent
rounding variations that would cause inappropriate differences at small point
sizes (for example, rounding one stroke to two pixels while rounding a similar
stroke to one pixel).</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Create
even “stepping” patterns and consistent widths for diagonal strokes.</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Keep
counters open at small sizes.</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Control
side bearings so glyphs don’t touch.</p>
