<h1><a name=1ni41qu></a>Example 2: Interpolating to Align Bowls</h1>

<p>By design, the bottom bowl of a Times New Roman “B” is wider than the top
bowl. With the previous interpolation, this design subtlety is apparent at 12
points. However, the bowls appear equal at 10 points, staggered again at 8
points, and aligned again at 6 points. </p>

<p>Additional instructions can make the bowls fall on the grid properly. First,
links from the side-bearing points control the placement of the left stroke and
the bottom round stroke. Next, interpolating between those links places the top
round stroke in proportion to the left (straight) stroke and the bottom round
stroke, like this:</p>

<p>These hints align the bowls at the three smaller sizes:</p>

<p><img width=131 height=131 alt="Aligned bowls at 10 point"
src="../images/bm124.gif"><img width=129
height=131 alt="Aligned bowls at 8 point" src="../images/bm125.gif"><img
width=131 height=131 alt="Aligned bowls at 6 point" src="../images/bm126.gif"></p>

<p><i>Aligned bowls at 10, 8, and 6 points and 96 dpi.</i></p>

<p>This example showed just one of many ways to align the bowls. Another
approach might be to link the two round strokes. However, you cannot
interpolate the bottom round stroke because it is not actually between
“between” the left straight stroke and the top round stroke:</p>

<p><i>Incorrect attempt to interpolate a child point not between the parent
points.</i></p>

<p>Attempting this interpolation creates a circular dependency, which Visual
TrueType won’t allow. A message will tell you what’s wrong, in this case
interpolating <i>between</i> parent points:</p>
