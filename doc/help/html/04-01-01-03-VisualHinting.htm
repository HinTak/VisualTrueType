<h1><a name="2f_gq55"></a>Visual Hinting at a Glance</h1>

<p>The application used to create a TrueType font produces glyph outlines, as
well as a ‘glyf’ table of binary TrueType data. Hinting with Visual TrueType
basically replaces that ‘glyf’ table with one produced by Visual TrueType. All
this happens behind the scenes as you drag and drop hints on screen.</p>

<p>Visual TrueType includes Visual TrueType Talk (VTT), a program that produces
source code from your on-screen hinting. Its own ‘glyf’ program turns that VTT
source into TrueType source code. In turn, Visual TrueType converts that
TrueType source code to TrueType binary data, which replaces the ‘glyf’ table
that came with the font. Together, the new ‘glyf’ table from Visual TrueType
and the glyph outline—as produced with the font program and possibly modified
with Visual TrueType—result in a hinted TrueType font.</p>

<p>To simplify hinting, Visual TrueType displays glyph characteristics and
hinting in distinctive ways so you can easily identify all parts of the glyph
and all its hints. What you see depends on which commands are selected in the
Visual TrueType menu (these same choices are available as check boxes in the
dialog box for the Display Options command, which is on the Display menu).
Selecting a Visual TrueType command or option displays the corresponding
feature in the main window. See the “Configuring Main window display options”
section for details on these options.</p>
