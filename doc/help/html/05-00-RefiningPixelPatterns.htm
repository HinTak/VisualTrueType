<h1><a name=11llsfv></a>Refining Pixel Patterns</h1>

<p>Hinting by grid-fitting, which applies to all sizes of a glyph, is more
efficient than manually editing bitmaps for every size of a glyph. However,
grid-fitting does have limits because it neither relates to a particular point
(or ppem) size nor specifies a particular number of pixels to be used. As a
result, at some point sizes, the computer might choose the wrong pixels. Often
you need to make an exception to the global hinting to improve the pixel
pattern around the round parts of the glyph.</p>

<p>With Visual TrueType, you can apply two kinds of exceptions to any control
point:</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
“delta” moves the control point a set number (whole or fraction) of pixel(s),
based on the ppem size. Each delta applies only to a particular size.</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
“move” moves the control point a set number (whole or fraction) of pixel(s),
too, but regardless of the ppem size. Each move applies to all sizes of the
glyph, so typographers find moves useful for improving the step pattern of
pixels on diagonals.</p>

<p>After you finish hinting one size of a glyph, you review the glyph size by
size. Your review should include all ppem sizes likely to be displayed on
screen. If a particular size doesn’t look good, you may need to fix its pixel
pattern by creating a delta or move. Either exception tells the computer to do
an additional operation to correct the problem and ensure a high-quality font.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> Each delta or move increases the disk space and amount of memory
required for a font. Applying an exception to the same point at many different
ppem sizes not only increases the font size for each ppem size, but also
indicates a need to change how you’re grid-fitting. Don’t create an exception
unless you’re sure it’s the best solution to a hinting problem.</p>

<p>You can tell Visual TrueType to apply the exception before or after it
applies the outgoing links and other hinting:</p>

<p>An “inline” exception moves the point <i>after</i> the incoming hints have
been applied, but <i>before</i> any outgoing hints have been applied. An inline
exception affects all subsequent links, interpolations, and other hints. This
approach works well for adjusting the position of entire features, such as the
position of a crossbar.</p>

<p>A “pre” exception moves the point <i>after</i> any incoming or outgoing
hints have been applied, but <i>before</i> the computer automatically smoothes
the outline. Links and interpolations significantly adjust the outline,
introducing many irregularities. Smoothing instructs the unhinted control
points to follow these dents and bumps “accordingly.” This approach works well
for adjusting the weight of features without affecting subsequent hints.</p>

<p>A “post” exception (the default) moves the point only <i>after</i> Visual
TrueType has applied all other hints and smoothed the outline. This approach
works well for adding or deleting individual pixels on the bitmap at the
specified ppem size.</p>

<p>Each time you create a delta or move, Visual TrueType automatically updates
the size run and on-screen glyph because you need to see the results of this
change immediately.</p>

<p>After finishing the exception hinting on a font, consider reviewing the
glyph at all sizes again, but with a different rasterizer. </p>
