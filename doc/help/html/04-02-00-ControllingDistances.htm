<h1><a name=3xccw12></a>Controlling Distances</h1>

<p>Most of your hinting will be done to control distances between points. You
can control distances two ways:</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Links
maintain a flexible relationship between two points. Usually, the link will
refer to an entry in the control value table (‘cvt’) to determine the position
of one point in relation to the other. If it doesn’t, the link is called a
distance. </p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Shifts
maintain a rigid relationship between two points. What affects one point
equally affects the other.</p>
