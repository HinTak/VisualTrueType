<h1><a name=xxz1o3></a>Importing a Glyph</h1>

<p>Importing a glyph or character replaces the current glyph with the outline
of a glyph from another font, plus all its hinting (its current VTT Talk and
the TrueType tables).</p>

<p>For example, you may want to start over on a particular glyph in a font. If
you have a copy of an earlier version of the font, you can retrieve individual
glyphs as needed. </p>

<p>Or, you may not be sure whether to hint a certain character as a composite
glyph or as individual glyphs. For example, the font designer may have used
Fontographer to created the glyph as a composite, but you find that you canâ€™t
hint it correctly. You can go back to Fontographer and create the character as
an individual glyph and import it into the font for hinting.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> If you import a composite character from a different font, the
only change in the main window will be re-arrangement of the individual glyphs
(that is, the components of the composite) according to the arrangement in the
imported font.</p>

<p>You can import any glyph from any font, as long as you know the correct
glyph index number. </p>
