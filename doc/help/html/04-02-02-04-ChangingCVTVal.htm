<h1><a name=x.o5dr></a>Changing the ‘Cvt’ Value for a Link</h1>

<p>To select the ‘cvt’ value for a link, Visual TrueType needs to know:</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
character group you’re working on (uppercase, lowercase, figure/numeral, or
“other”). This information gets loaded into your font when you prepare it for
hinting (see “Preparing the Open Font”).</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
color of the link. Visual TrueType actually “looks” at the character and checks
whether your link lies entirely within the black or the white part of the
character (making it a black or white link, respectively). If the color is
neither back nor white, Visual TrueType assumes a gray link.</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
direction of the link. Visual TrueType determines this based on the direction
of the link tool used to create the link.</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
‘cvt’ category the link relates to. This information comes from the arrowhead
you select to specify the control value category and minimum distance for the
link—because the current default category applies to each new link, make sure
this is the category you intended (see “Assigning a ‘Cvt’ Category to a Link”).
</p>

<p>Once it has all this information, Visual TrueType searches the ‘cvt’ table
and finds the entry that best matches the size and other attributes of the
link. The search follows this order:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If several control value table entries have the same attribute, Visual
TrueType picks the one whose control value is closest to the actual distance of
the link.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This would be the case, for example, for uppercase black strokes of
Times New Roman in the X direction because they have a dominant thin stroke
with a dominant thick stroke.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If only one entry has that attribute, Visual TrueType picks that one, no
matter how close or how far away it is from the actual distance of the link.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If no entry has that attribute, Visual TrueType searches the table again
using the ‘cvt’ category of “distance.”</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If “distance” doesn’t have that attribute, Visual TrueType tries one
last time with the link direction set to “any.”</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If even that fails, then the link will not refer to a ‘cvt’ value. A
question mark displays in the numbered highway sign, and you may have to add an
entry to the ‘cvt’ table. </p>

<p>Even if Visual TrueType finds a match, you may want to change it. For
example, when you link to control stem thickness, Visual TrueType can pick the
correct ‘cvt’ value only if the relevant ‘cvt’ entries have associated
character groups and the correct character group is assigned to the current
glyph. </p>

<p>Or Visual TrueType might choose an entry that you don’t want to use. For
example, you may want two round strokes to refer to the same ‘cvt’ entry.</p>

<p>You can review and change the associated ‘cvt’ entry using the highway signs
displayed on links. Choose between smaller, unnumbered highway signs or larger
signs that include the number of the ‘cvt’ entry for each link. </p>

<p>In either case, holding down the right mouse button as you click the highway
sign displays a list of entries from the ‘cvt’ table:</p>

<p><img width=460 height=274 alt="CVT table values menu" src="../images/CVTlist.png"></p>

<p>The selected entry is the one already associated with the link or, if none
exists yet, Visual TrueType’s best guess, plus a dozen neighboring entries from
the ‘cvt’ table. You can scroll this list to select another entry.</p>

<p><b>To change a ‘cvt’ entry for a link</b></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Visual TrueType Options submenu of the Display menu, ensure that
the Cvts option is enabled. You can also enable the Cvt Numbers option to
display CVT numbers inside the highway signs on links.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select the XLink or YLink tool by clicking the appropriate icon, or by
pressing the F5 or F1 key, respectively</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Point on the highway sign for the link you want to change.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Holding down the right mouse button, and click a rounding method from
the menu (for details, see “Rounding Control Points”).</p>
