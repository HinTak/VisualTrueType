<h1><a name="2m1b_na"></a>Setting Initial Control Values</h1>

<p>Preparing the font creates the template for the ‘cvt’ table. All the
important control value numbers will be there, along with the hexadecimal number
and other comments such as:</p>

<p>/* STEMS: UC, STRAIGHT, X */</p>

<p>However, the control values will be 0, to be supplied by you. Before hinting
a font, you need to measure all the glyphs in the font and fill in the
template.</p>

<p>First, disable the Grid Fit and Pixel display so the control values will be
in F-units. You can do this either by clicking these option on the General
Options submenu of the Display menu, or by pressing Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;G (to
disable gridfit) and then Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;B (to disable pixels). Next, open
the ‘cvt’ table in its own text window. Based on what’s listed there, use the
Measuring tool to measure all glyphs or representative glyphs (H, O, f, g h, o,
x) in F-units one at time for standard heights and distances, such as the cap
height for all uppercase glyphs. You’re measuring the outline, which shows the
original design, because the bitmap version might not correspond exactly.
Usually, the stroke weights and other spatial relationships vary slightly from
glyph to glyph. </p>

<p>As you measure a representative glyph, write down the result, which is the
top-right value in the status bar. This can take some time for an entire font,
but doing this accurately is very important. The Measuring tool ensures precise
values and streamlines the repetitive measuring needed to determine ‘cvt’
values.</p>

<p>Finally, enter the dominant values in the ‘cvt’ table. When you finish,
compile the cvt table (Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;R), and save (Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;S), so
the TrueType rasterizer applies these new values to the font (see “Compiling
Your Results”). </p>

<p><b>To fill in the ‘cvt’ template</b></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the Views menu, click Control Values, or press Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;4.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Resize and position the Control Value Table window so you can see it
while working on a glyph in the main window.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click in the main window (or press Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;1).</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If already selected in the General Options submenu of the Display menu,
click to clear Grid Fit and Pixels, or press Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;G then Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;B</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select the Measuring tool by either clicking its icon on the toolbar, or
press F9. Referring to the values listed in the ‘cvt’ table, use the Measuring
tool to measure all glyphs (or representative glyphs) in the font for a
specified feature (say, dominant uppercase stem width in the X direction).</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the ‘cvt’ table, locate the appropriate comment for the feature
measurement you have just taken, and replace the 0 value with the value you
measured for the feature.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat Steps 5 and 6 for each value in the ‘cvt’ template.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Compile the Control Values by selecting the Compile submenu of the Tools
menu, then clicking Control Values, or by pressing Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;R. </p>
