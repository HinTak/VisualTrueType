<h1><a name=iuvju8></a>Exporting Text</h1>

<p>You can export the contents of a text-based window and save it as a text
file. Later, you can import that text file into another font or edit it with
any text editor or word-processing software, such as WordPad or Microsoft Word.
</p>

<p>This is handy, for example, if you want to export the Font Error window and
then send that text file as an e-mail attachment to another typographer. Or you
may want to save your completed ‘cvt’ table—you could use it with other fonts
in the same family, or you could name it CvtTmpl.txt and save it in the Visual
TrueType folder as a template.</p>
