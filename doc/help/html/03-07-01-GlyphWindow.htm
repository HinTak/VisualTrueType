<h1><a name=1xqvxky></a>Using the Character/Glyph Set Window</h1>

<p>The Character/Glyph Set window contains every glyph included in the open
font. Clicking a character in the Character/Glyph Set window displays that
character in the main window. </p>

<p>Selecting the Refresh Char Set with Main Window option as a preference
synchronizes the Character/Glyph Set window and the main window. Both windows
will display at the same point size (as selected in the Size menu) and
resolution (as selected in the Resolution menu). Other synchronized options
include grid fitting, gray scaling, sbit on or off, and MS Rasterizer. </p>

<p>Similarly, glyphs are displayed by glyph index or character code (Unicode),
depending on whether Access Characters by Glyph Index is selected as a
preference. If by character code, glyphs follow the Cmap chosen in the
Preferences dialog box. </p>

<p>For details, see “Setting Preferences”</p>
