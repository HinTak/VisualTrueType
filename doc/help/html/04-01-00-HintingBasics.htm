<h1><a name=pinrn1></a>Hinting Basics</h1>

<p>Designers of PostScript fonts provided “hints,” or general guidelines that
the PostScript interpreter could use to decide which pixels to turn on. Later,
TrueType took hinting a step further because font designers could add detailed instructions—essentially
programming code—that tell the rasterizer exactly what to do to optimize the
appearance of the font.</p>

<p>This user guide won’t teach you how to hint—it assumes you already know how
to do that. This chapter gives a brief overview of hinting, explains tasks you
can do before you start hinting, and describes some basic features of hinting
with Visual TrueType.</p>
