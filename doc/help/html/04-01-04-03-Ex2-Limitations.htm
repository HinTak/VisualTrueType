<h1><a name=7tqma7></a>Example 2: Rounding Limitations</h1>

<p>The following example illustrates the limitations of rounding by itself.
Assume that the 12-point Times New Roman “m” shown earlier in this chapter has
hints telling the rasterizer to position certain control points on the nearest
grid line and to let the other points follow accordingly. A short bar marks
each hinted point that controls vertical strokes:</p>

<p><img width=162 height=140 alt="Rounding indicators for vertical control points"
src="../images/RoundingEx2-1.gif"></p>

<p><i>Short bars show rounding methods on vertical control points.</i></p>

<p>For the horizontal strokes, a short bar marks each hinted control point:</p>

<p><img width=168 height=138 alt="Rounding indicators for vertical control points"
src="../images/RoundingEx2-2.gif"></p>

<p><i>Short bars show rounding methods on horizontal control points.</i></p>

<p>After Visual TrueType compiles the hints, the resulting glyph looks better.
Even so, the left stem is still twice as wide as the other two, and the serifs
are now missing altogether:</p>

<p><img width=167 height=138 alt="Bitmap of 12-point Times New Roman m after rounding"
src="../images/RoundingEx2-3.gif"></p>

<p><i>The bitmap of a 12-point Times New Roman “m” after rounding.</i></p>

<p>Hinting just the control points improved the appearance of the font, but the
outline needs more hints to look good. Visual TrueType encourages you to go
beyond this basic approach by making rounding part of the links that you create
and interpolate to hint control points. For more information, see “Controlling
Distances,” and “Controlling Proportions.”</p>
