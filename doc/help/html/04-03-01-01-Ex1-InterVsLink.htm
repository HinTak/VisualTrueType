<h1><a name="1gj_y3"></a>Example 1: Interpolating Rather Than Linking</h1>

<p>Interpolating improves hinting on a Times New Roman “B” with its straight
and round strokes, vertical and horizontal strokes, and pair of serifs. Start
with these links:</p>

<p><img width=150 height=152 alt="Times New Roman B with basic links"
src="../images/bm114.gif"></p>

<p><i>Basic links on a Times New Roman “B.”</i></p>

<p>The result looks good at 12 points and a device resolution of 96 dpi:</p>

<p><img width=146 height=146 alt="The resulting 12-point “B” at 96 dpi"
src="../images/bm115.gif"></p>

<p><i>The resulting 12-point “B” at 96 dpi.</i></p>

<p>However, the results look less acceptable at 10, 8, and 6 points:</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
10 points, the two round strokes (bowls) align on top of each other, which may
or may not be desirable. The pixel pattern of the bowls is a separate issue. </p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
8 points, the outlines don’t fall on the grid nearly as gracefully as at 12
points. The middle (horizontal) stroke ends up disproportionately high relative
to the bottom and top strokes. </p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
6 points, the top bowl collapses, although the cap height of 5 pixels should be
enough to mimic three strokes and two counters between.</p>

<p><img width=132 height=132 alt="B at 10 point at 96 dpi"
src="../images/bm116.gif"><img width=132
height=132 alt="B at 8 point at 96 dpi" src="../images/bm117.gif"><img
width=132 height=134 alt="B at 6 point at 96 dpi" src="../images/bm118.gif"></p>

<p><i>The same hinting at 10, 8, and 6 points and 96 dpi.</i></p>

<p>The problems illustrated here relate to rounding. The fractional number
representing the cap height was rounded down, while the number representing the
placement of the middle stroke was rounded up. This changed the placement of
the middle stroke relative to the baseline and cap height. </p>

<p>To correct these problems, hints must instruct the computer to do three
tasks:</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fit
the cap height and base line to the grid.</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Determine
the number of pixels needed to position the middle stroke in proportion to the
newly fitted cap height and base line.</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fit
the bottom edge of the middle stroke to the grid that many pixels away from the
baseline (the bottom edge of the middle stroke, in turn, is linked to the top
edge of the middle stroke).</p>

<p>An interpolation can convey all these instructions. </p>

<p><img width=147 height=146 alt="Interpolating the middle stroke of the “B.”"
src="../images/bm119.gif"></p>

<p><i>Interpolating the middle stroke of the “B.”</i></p>

<p>This one interpolation improves the appearance of the Times New Roman “B” at
10, 8, and 6 points:</p>

<p><img width=132 height=132 alt="Interpolated results at 10 point"
src="../images/bm120.gif"><img width=131
height=132  alt="Interpolated results at 8 point" src="../images/bm121.gif"><img
width=132 height=132  alt="Interpolated results at 6 point" src="../images/bm122.gif"></p>
