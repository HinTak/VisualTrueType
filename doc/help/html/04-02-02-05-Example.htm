<h1><a name=xuhhgq></a>Example: Linking with ‘Cvt’ Entries:</h1>

<p>The Times New Roman “O” seems an easy glyph to hint with links in from the
side-bearings and across the two vertical round strokes, plus links across the
two horizontal round strokes:</p>

<p><img width=171 height=162 alt="Preliminary linking on a Times New Roman “O”" src="../images/bm102.gif"></p>

<p><i>Preliminary linking on a Times New Roman “O”</i></p>

<p>The computer picked pairs of ‘cvt’ values for the vertical and horizontal
links. However, the question mark indicates that the computer wasn’t able to
determine the ‘cvt’ value for the left side-bearing. In this case, the ‘cvt’
table didn’t have an entry with the attribute “Uppercase White X LSB” (LSB for
left side-bearing point).</p>

<p>Correcting that problem still leaves others evident if you examine several
sizes of the “O” along with an “H”:</p>

<p><img width=279 height=153 alt="H and O at 15 point" src="../images/bm103.gif"><br>
<img width=261 height=144 alt="H and O at 14 point" src="../images/bm104.gif"><br>
<img width=276 height=152 alt="H and O at 13 point" src="../images/bm105.gif"></p>

<p><i>“H” and “O” at 15, 14, and 13 points and 96 dpi</i></p>

<p>This unacceptable variation is the result of how the strokes fall on the
grid. The weights of the vertical strokes jump from 1 pixel to 2 pixels in both
the “H” and the “O.” In addition, the left and the right “O” overshoots the
“H,”, but not the middle one, yet no “O” undershoots the ‘“H.” Although the
design of the “O” includes some undershoots and overshoots, none are as extreme
as the left one nor that irregular.</p>

<p>You can correct these problems by referring the links to ‘cvt’ values. The
‘cvt’ table has values for several heights (descender, baseline, x-height, cap
height, and ascender), as well as their overshoots. The heights specify real
values. However, the overshoots specify the difference between the actual
overshoot and the respective height. </p>

<p>In this case, the ‘cvt’ table has these entries for the baseline and the cap
height:</p>

<p>/* CAP_HEIGHT */</p>

<p>2: 1356</p>

<p>3: 31</p>

<p>/* UC_BASE_HEIGHT */</p>

<p>8: 0</p>

<p>9: -31</p>

<p>So, the cap height is at 1356 while the caps height overshoot is 31 <i>above</i>
1356. Likewise, the baseline is at 0 while the baseline undershoot is 31 below
0. This assures that the bottom and the top round stroke have the same weight. </p>

<p>Because an “O” usually has no control points that sit exactly on the cap
height, you cannot link from the cap height to its overshoot. Instead, you tell
the computer what that distance would be if you could link it. Then the
computer will make that distance behave just like a link without minimum
distance. </p>

<p><b>Note</b> Not specifying a minimum distance avoids overshoots at small
ppem sizes, because even a one-pixel overshoot will be too much at sufficiently
small ppem sizes. Although no overshoot is wrong, it’s a better choice than a
one-pixel overshoot.</p>
