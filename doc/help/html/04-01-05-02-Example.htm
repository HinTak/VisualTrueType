<h1><a name="1_vn2wh"></a>Example: Anchoring a Height</h1>

<p>In general, you should specify the ‘cvt’ values for heights before
specifying ‘cvt’ values for links and interpolates in the Y direction. You’ll
anchor the height of this Times New Roman “O.” In this example, Anchors is
selected and Links And Dists de-selected in the Visual TrueType menu:</p>

<p><img width=158 height=167 alt="Capital O with anchors" src="../images/Anchors-O-NoCVT.gif"></p>

<p><i>The “O” with anchors.</i></p>

<p>Only the two Y anchors have highway signs. The signs are blank because the
‘cvt’ values for heights don’t come with a ‘cvt’ attribute, which the computer
needs to determine which height a ‘cvt’ value refers to. You must enter the
‘cvt’ value.</p>

<p>For this example, the top anchor refers to ‘cvt’ entry 3 and the bottom
anchor to ‘cvt’ entry 9, even though these entries specify only the overshoots
(31 and -31, respectively), not the actual heights (1536 and 0). The computer
knows how to handle this because the first ‘cvt’ entries are reserved for the
heights.</p>

<p><img width=158 height=167 alt="Capital O with anchors and CVT values" src="../images/Anchors-O-CVT.gif"></p>

<p><i>The “O” with anchors and ‘cvt’ values.</i></p>

<p>For the “H,” the ‘cvt’ entries would be 2 and 8 instead, because the glyph
has no overshoots. This solves the alignment problem.</p>
