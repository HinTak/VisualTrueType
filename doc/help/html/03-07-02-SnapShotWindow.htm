<h1><a name=ezuq87></a>Using the Snap Shot of Main Window</h1>

<p>Opening the Snap Shot of Main Window creates a copy of the main window. If
you make additional changes to the glyph in the main window, Visual TrueType
does not update the snapshot to reflect those changes. </p>

<p>You can take a snapshot two ways. Click the Snap Shot of Main command on the
View menu, or click the Camera tool in the toolbar:</p>

<p><img width=104 height=80 alt="Camera tool icon"
src="../images/Toolbar-Snapshot.png"></p>

<p>You can size and position the snapshot window next to the main window. This
side-by-side view can be handy if, for example, you finish hinting a glyph and
want to refer to that hinting as you work on a similar glyph (such as E and F
or C and Ç). </p>

<p>You can’t change anything in the Snap Shot of Main Window. However, you can
change views with the Panning tool, Zoom-in tool, and Zoom-out tool. In
addition, you can use the Measuring tool.</p>

<p>The Snap Shot of Main Window remains open until you either take a new
snapshot or close the window.</p>
