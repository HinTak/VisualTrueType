<h1><a name=1mqrkdi></a>Strategy: Distance or Link</h1>

<p>If you create a distance with no ‘cvt’ value, Visual TrueType follows this
procedure to position the child control point:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Fit one edge of the stem to the grid.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Calculate the pixels needed to represent the weight of the stem.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With that number of pixels in-between, fit the other edge of the stem to
the grid.</p>

<p>With a Times New Roman “B,” this approach yields mixed results from rounding
fractional numbers up or down:</p>

<p><img width=128 height=128 alt="Varied rounding of Times New Roman B at 12 point"

   <img width=131 height=131 alt="Varied rounding of Times New Roman B at 11 point"
	src="../images/bm88.gif">
   <img width=132 height=131 alt="Varied rounding of Times New Roman B at 10 point"
	src="../images/bm89.gif"></p>

<p><i>Rounding varies stroke width in a Times New Roman “B” at 12, 11, and 10
points and 96 dpi.</i></p>

<p>The left straight stem changes from 2 pixels to 1 pixel at 11 points, while
the right round stems do so only at 10 points. By design, these round strokes
are wider than the straight one, but not double the width as displayed at 11
points. Apparently, the computer calculated just over 1.5 pixels for the round
strokes and just under 1.5 pixels for the straight stroke. Rounded to the
nearest number of pixels, the round and straight strokes became 2 and 1 pixels,
respectively. </p>

<p>You could use the “round-down-to-grid” or “round-up-to-grid” attributes to
control the stems better. However, in this case, the situation is both too frequent
and too fundamental a problem to be dealt by changing the rounding attributes. </p>

<p>Instead, the better solution is to refer to a ‘cvt’ value, changing the
distance to a link. The key to the solution lies in the fact that several links
can then refer to the same control value. </p>

<p>When you create a link, it refers to a control value, so Visual TrueType
changes Step 2 of the procedure it follows to position the child point. After
working out the fractional number of pixels to represent the weight of the
stem, it compares that result to the fractional number of the scaled control
value. If these two numbers are “almost the same,” it uses the scaled control
value, not the original distance between the control points, to calculate the
pixels. As a result, all links that refer to the same control value will “lock
into” the same number of pixels at “sufficiently small sizes.”</p>
