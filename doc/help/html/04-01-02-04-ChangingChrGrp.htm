<h1><a name=12ob0ab></a>Changing a Glyph’s Character Group </h1>

<p>The CharGrp.txt file for the font assigns each glyph to a character group:
uppercase, lowercase, figure, or other. The character group tells Visual
TrueType which group of values to use from the control value table (‘cvt’) for
the glyph.</p>

<p>Occasionally, you might want to use the ‘cvt’ values from a different group.
For example, the font designer may have classified a dollar sign ($) as a
figure. However, while hinting it, you decide that the glyph looks more like an
uppercase “S.” </p>

<p>Changing the glyph’s character group won’t affect ‘cvt’ values already
applied to the glyph. However for subsequent ‘cvt’ values you assign, Visual
TrueType will use the new character group.</p>

<p><b>Tip</b> Change the character group, if necessary, before assigning any
‘cvt’ values.</p>

<p>Sometimes<b> </b>typographers turn on the sample text at the top of the main
window (on the Display menu, click Show Text String) and cycle through all the
character groups to check glyph spacing. The first part of the sample text
displays the current glyph between two glyphs typical for the current character
group, followed by extra text (see “Setting Preferences”). </p>

<p>For instance, if the current glyph is A, the text string starts with
HHAHOHOAOOAAA. If you change the character group to lowercase, the text string
starts with nnAnonoAooAA, which shows how the A spaces with those characters.</p>

<p>You make this change with the Change Char Group command from the Edit menu.
Each time you choose the command, Visual TrueType changes the character group
displayed in the status bar. Just keep choosing the command until the status
bar displays the character group you want for the glyph in the main window.</p>

<p><b>To change the character group of the current glyph</b></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the Edit menu, click Change Char Group, or press Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;U.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If necessary, repeat until the status bar displays the correct character
group. </p>
