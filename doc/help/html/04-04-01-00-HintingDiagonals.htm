<h1><a name="4grn_o2"></a>Hinting Diagonal Strokes</h1>

<p>To hint diagonal strokes, you use the Stroke tool to define the width of
each diagonal. Then, because other hinting might change the position of control
points that are supposed to be aligned along the diagonal, you can assure their
alignment. </p>
