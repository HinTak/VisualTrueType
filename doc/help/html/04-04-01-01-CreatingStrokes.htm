<h1><a name=m1nnes></a>Creating Strokes</h1>

<p>A stroke is the easiest way to assure a uniform width on a diagonal. Created
by dragging with the Stroke tool, a stroke connects a “parent” control point to
a “child” point, then links that linked pair to another linked parent and
child. The two parent points don’t have to be on the same side of the diagonal.
</p>

<p>You use the same tool for all strokes because strokes aren’t specific to an
X or Y direction.</p>

<p>When you select the Stroke tool, the pointer looks like this:</p>

<p><img width=38 height=37 alt="Stroke tool cursor"

<p>Before creating the stroke, you should add links, interpolations, or other
hints to control the parent points and possibly round them to the grid. In
addition, make sure both Show X Direction and Show Y Direction are selected in
the Display Options dialog. This is necessary because a stroke can cause the
child points to flex in either the X or Y direction. Because Visual TrueType
determines that flexing after applying the stroke, both directions must be
available.</p>

<p>To begin the stroke, you drag the Stroke tool to connect the first parent
point to its child point. This leaves a black arrow between the two points.</p>

<p>Then you drag to connect the second parent point to its child point. As you
drag, solid black fills in the area between the four points. When you release the
mouse button, black lines replace the solid black. If the stroke is within ±
45° of the vertical, the lines are horizontal; otherwise, the black lines are
vertical.</p>

<p><b>Note </b>A stroke with all horizontal black lines will be considered
closer to vertical than horizontal. Consequently, Visual TrueType applies same
logic it uses to determine circular dependencies in links in the X direction to
determine circular dependencies in the two arrows at either end of the stroke.
Likewise, a stroke with all vertical black lines will be considered closer to
horizontal than vertical, with its arrows subject to the same logic applied to
links in the Y direction.</p>

<p>Like links and anchors, strokes can refer to a value in the control value
table (‘cvt’). When Cvts or Cvt Numbers is selected in the Visual TrueType
menu, a highway sign appears in the black stroke. (Cvt Numbers tells Visual
TrueType to display a larger version of the highway sign, along with the ‘cvt’
number, if any, applied to the stroke.) </p>

<p>When you hold down the Shift key and click the sign with the Stroke tool,
Visual TrueType displays entries from the ‘cvt’ table. You can scroll that list
until you find the entry that relates to the weight of the stroke.</p>

<p>The following example shows two strokes applied to the two legs of an
uppercase “A.” Because two arrows cannot end at the same point, all strokes
move from the inside edge of the glyph to the outside edge. Both strokes
display ‘cvt’ values, too:</p>

<p><i>Two strokes define the width of the diagonals on an “A.” Because the
strokes are within ± 45° of the vertical, the stroke lines are horizontal.</i></p>

<p><b>Tip</b> When you’re not working with strokes, you can hide them to make
more room on the screen for other visual hinting. On the Visual TrueType menu,
the Strokes command toggles between hiding and displaying all strokes.</p>

<p>To create Strokes via the keyboard, you must type the appropriate VTT Talk
commands into the VTT Talk window (Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;5).</p>
