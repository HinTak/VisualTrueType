<h1><a name="e_0qm3"></a>Example 2: Creating Links</h1>

<p>Visual TrueType keeps track of your links so that you cannot do something
that wonâ€™t work. For example, a chain of links can be useful to control the
curve of the serif:</p>

<p><img width=78 height=146 alt="Vertical links 1" src="../images/bm82.gif"><img
width=78 height=144 alt="Vertical links 2" src="../images/bm83.gif"><img
width=78 height=146 alt="Vertical links 3" src="../images/bm84.gif"></p>

<p><i>A chain of three vertical links.</i></p>

<p>Adding a fourth link might seem like a good idea to assure that the stem is
identical to other such stems in the same font: </p>

<p><img width=78 height=146 alt="Vertical links 4" src="../images/bm85.gif"></p>

<p><i>Adding a fourth link.</i></p>

<p>However, this is one link too many. A link specifies which part of the
character must not give way upon fitting the outline to the grid. This implies
that something else must give way. But if the last link in the chain links back
to the starting point, nothing can give way. Visual TrueType will display a
message like: </p>

<p><img width=675 height=272 alt="Circular dependency error"
src="../images/Error-CircularDependency.png"></p>

<p><i>A chain of links cannot begin and end at the same control point.</i></p>

<p>The last link must not link back to a control point used earlier in the
chain.<b> </b>Visual TrueType alerts you so you can delete a link from the
chain or forego the last link you tried to create.</p>
