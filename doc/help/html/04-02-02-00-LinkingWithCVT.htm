<h1><a name=hzc088></a>Linking with ‘Cvt’ Values</h1>

<p>A font should have certain constant relationships between glyphs. For
example, the dominant weight of the stems should apply to round stems, as well
as straight stems, and certain control points should fall on the baseline. You can
achieve this control over relationships by having links refer to entries in the
control value table (‘cvt’).</p>

<p>By default, Visual TrueType assumes that every link should refer to a ‘cvt’
value. That value specifies how far, in whole pixels rounded to the grid at the
current ppem size, the child point is from the parent point.</p>

<p>Several links can refer to the same control value. This helps control
consistency throughout the font at different point sizes and device
resolutions.</p>

<p>Only unique distances unrelated to any other distance don’t require a ‘cvt’
value. A link without a ‘cvt’ value is called a distance.</p>
