<h1><a name=18hqeya></a>Hinting in the VTT Talk Window</h1>

<p>The graphical interface does not offer all the commands of VTT Talk, either
because the respective VTT Talk commands were seldom used or defy a graphical
representation. For example, you can call a function from the Font Program,
though there is no visual hinting command for this.</p>

<p>Because these instructions can change the state of the rasterizer, VTT will
lock down the visual hinting tools in the main window whenever you use
instructions that cannot be represented by visual hints. However, VTT will
still display graphical representations of all supported VTT Talk commands. In
addition, you still can compile the VTT Talk window and print the hinted font
to see the results of your work.</p>
