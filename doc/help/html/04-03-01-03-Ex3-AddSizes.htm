<h1><a name=1nidvtn></a>Example 3: Interpolating at Additional Sizes</h1>

<p>The interpolations in Example 1 and Example 2 have made a Times New Roman
“B” that looks good at 12, 10, 8, and 6 points. However, you still must review
the “B” at other sizes to see if the results are acceptable. In this case, the
7-point “B” doesn’t look as good as the adjacent sizes:</p>

<p><img width=129 height=131 alt="Times New Roman B at 8 point"
src="../images/bm129.gif"><img width=132
height=132 alt="Times New Roman B at 7 point" src="../images/bm129.gif"><img
width=131 height=131 alt="Times New Roman B at 6 point"src="../images/bm129.gif"></p>

<p><i>Times New Roman “B” at 8, 7, and 6 points and 96 dpi.</i></p>

<p>Note the control point at the crotch of the two bowls. The interpolation
moves the middle stroke up or down a little bit, and this point follows
“accordingly.” At the even sizes (8 and 6 points), the control point hovers
around the center of the pixel. At 7 points, however, “accordingly” positions
the control point near the bottom of the pixel. </p>

<p>Correcting this requires more hinting to define “accordingly.” You can do
that by interpolating the control point between the top and the bottom edge of
the middle stroke:</p>

<p><img width=146 height=146 alt="Controlling more and more details"
src="../images/bm132.gif"></p>

<p><i>Controlling more and more details...</i></p>

<p>For clarity, the above illustration shows the interpolations with pixels
turned off, but grid-fitting still on. Turning the pixels back on shows that
the new interpolation has produced the desired results:</p>

<p><img width=129 height=131 alt="Revised B at 8 points"
src="../images/bm133.gif"><img width=132
height=132 alt="Revised B at 7 points" src="../images/bm133.gif"><img
width=131 height=131 alt="Revised B at 6 points" src="../images/bm133.gif"></p>

<p><i>...for increasingly better results.</i></p>
