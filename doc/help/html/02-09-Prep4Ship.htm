<h1>Preparing to Ship Your Font</h1>

<p>You’ve finished hinting. You’ve compiled the font, approved the printed
version, reduced the amount of space required by the font, and saved all the
results. Before the font is ready for users, you have to do one more task:
prepare the font for shipping.</p>

<p>The saved version of your font file contains all the source data for the
hinting you’ve done. You should keep that file in case you later decide to do
additional hinting to the font or want to import glyphs from it to hint another
font.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Note</b> You must recalculate the ‘maxp’ table
before preparing to ship your font (see “Reducing Memory Requirements”). </p>

<p>The version you give to users should not contain all those Visual
TrueType-related private tables—users don’t need that hinting data. Including
it in the font not only increases the disk space required by the font, but also
gives away data you should protect. Otherwise, users can see how you hinted the
font and change it, hint a new version of the font, and otherwise appropriate
your work.</p>

<p>Before distributing the font to any users, prepare a “ship” version that’s
been stripped of that private data. Visual TrueType removes the Visual TrueType
source code and the TrueType source code (or glyph program) assembled from that
Visual TrueType source code, but not the binary TrueType ‘glyf’ table created
from the TrueType source code.</p>

<p><i>Be sure to rename the version you’ll be shipping to users.</i></p>

<p>Save the ship version with a new file name, and keep that version separate
from your source file of the font. Use that shipped version to make copies of
the font for users.</p>

<p>If you forget to rename the file, a prompt asks you to confirm that you want
to overwrite the version that contains all your hinting.</p>

<p>Because “shipping” the font strips out all that work, you don’t want to
overwrite the original version. Click Cancel, click Prepare Font again, and
change the name of the shipped version. </p>
