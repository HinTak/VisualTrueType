<h1><a name=115bxq></a>Working with Other Windows</h1>

<p>Although you can hint only one glyph at a time in the main window, you can
open two other graphical windows that might be useful for visual hinting: the
Character/Glyph Set Window and Snap Shot of Main Window. All three graphical
windows are available as commands on the View menu with keyboard shortcuts:
Main Window (Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;1), Character Set (Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;9), or Snap
Shot of Main (Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;0).</p>

<p>From the View menu, you can open several text-based windows that enable you
to edit font data. All users will need to open and edit the Control Program
window, which is a text window of source data for the control value table, or
‘cvt’ (see “Using the Control Value Table”). More for advanced users who need
access to the technical data behind Visual TrueType. For details about other
text-based windows, see “Advanced Hinting.”</p>

<p>Only one window can be active at a time. Use standard Windows techniques to
select, position, and size these windows conveniently for you.</p>

<p>Closing the main window also closes the font. For details, see “Opening and
Closing a Font”.</p>
