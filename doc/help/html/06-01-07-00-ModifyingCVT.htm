<h1><a name=1nb.lvh></a>Modifying the ‘Cvt’ Table</h1>

<p>The control value table (‘cvt’) contains values defining lengths, widths,
and angles of glyph features. Some values are specific to certain glyphs. Other
values apply to the entire font or a group of glyphs, such as all uppercase
characters. All control values have an identification (ID) number, as well as
an attribute providing information about the type of glyph or feature to which
it pertains (for details, see “Reading ‘Cvt’ Entries”).</p>

<p>Visual TrueType imports a template for the ‘cvt’ table when you prepare the
font (see “Preparing the Open Font”). At any time, you can choose Control
Values on theViews menu and modify the contents of that table three ways:</p>

<p>Fill in the control values indicated in the template, then add your own ‘cvt’
entries starting with the next available ID number.</p>

<p>Create the ‘cvt’ table from scratch by opening the Control Value window and
replacing the template with entries you type (see “Editing Text”). </p>

<p>Import a ‘cvt’ table from another font to replace the contents of the
Control Value window (see “Importing Text”).</p>

<p>All control values are in F-units scaled to the ppem height of the grid in
use by the rasterizer.</p>
