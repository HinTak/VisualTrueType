<h1><a name=a04jbp></a>Reviewing ‘Cvt’ Values for Links</h1>

<p>Every link has what looks like a highway sign. When you want to review or
change the ‘cvt’ value assigned to a link, you should display those signs.
Otherwise, hiding them makes the links and other on-screen hinting easier to
see. </p>

<p><img width=146 height=147 alt="The X links of a Times New Roman “B” with highway signs showing ‘ cvt’
values" 
	src="../images/bm90.gif"></p>

<p><i>The X links of a Times New Roman “B” with highway signs showing ‘ cvt’
values.</i></p>

<p>You can display large highway signs that include the sequential line number
of the ‘cvt’ value used by each link, or you can turn on smaller, unnumbered
signs. For details, see “Hinting with ‘Cvt’ Values”</p>

<p><b>Note</b> A distance will not display a highway sign.</p>
