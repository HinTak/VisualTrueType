<p>Each glyph has two side-bearing control points: one on the left and one on
the right. The right side bearing point also determines the advance width of
the glyph, measured from the left side bearing point. </p>

<p>Links and other hints often start or end at side bearing points. By default,
Visual TrueType rounds the side bearing points to the grid. You can’t change
the rounding method.</p>

<p>You usually don’t move the side bearing points either. However, sometimes
you may need to adjust them. For example, the font might have some rounding
errors incurred in the conversion from a Fontographer file (where the font
height is 1,000 units) into a TrueType file (where font height is 2,048 units).</p>

<p>Or the side-bearing points might be very close to other control points, so
distinguishing the points becomes difficult, even at enlarged views. If that
happens, you might move the problematic side-bearing point an easy-to-remember
distance (say, 100 units), finish hinting the adjacent control points, and then
restore the side-bearing point to its original location.</p>

<p><i>Use the Edit Metrics command to move the left side-bearing point or the
advance width, which moves the right side-bearing point.</i></p>

<p>Editing the metrics of composite characters involves additional
considerations. For details, see “Composite Characters: Using the ‘Glyf’
Table”.</p>
