<p>Visual TrueType shows relationships between points, connected by arrows. At
a glance, you’ll know characteristics of those relationships by studying:</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
color of the arrows (green for Y direction links, red for X direction links, grey
for flexible interpolations, black for shifts and strokes, and blue for strokes).</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Orientation
of the arrowheads (X, Y, or any direction).</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Shape
of the arrowheads (identifying the most frequent control value categories of
straight stem, round stem, and any distance).</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Control
points and their rounding methods (none, to grid, to half-grid, to double-grid,
down-to-grid, and up-to-grid).</p>

<p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Other
symbols represent the presence or absence of an anchored point, a control value
table (‘cvt’), or an override for a minimum distance.</p>

<p>You use your mouse to drag and drop arrows until the on-screen character
looks its best at different sizes. For example, you can drag arrows,
arrowheads, and arrow tails to change the relationships between points. By
displaying pop-up menus, you can change or remove attributes such as ‘cvt’
category, ‘cvt’ number, rounding methods, and freedom vectors. Alternatively,
you can add or adjust any of these relationships by typing the relevant
commands in the VTT Talk window.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> Visual TrueType also can edit the GASP font table as well as
low-level hinting instructions. </p>
