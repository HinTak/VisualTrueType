<h1><a name=4b3jebe></a>Reducing Memory Requirements</h1>

<p>Every font comes with a table that is a collection of maximum possible
(‘maxp’) values for the computer memory required by each glyph. As you hint the
font, Visual TrueType automatically updates the ‘maxp’ table if the hinted
glyph requires more memory. This is necessary so the rasterizer can display the
glyph correctly.</p>

<p>Visual TrueType only keeps track of maximum values. If subsequent changes to
the hinting reduce the amount of memory needed, Visual TrueType doesn’t update
the ‘maxp’ table. As a result, by the time you finish hinting the font, some
glyphs might need less than the maximum. </p>

<p>The final version of your font should require only as much memory as
necessary. Before you save your font for the last time, you can have Visual
TrueType recalculate values for the ‘maxp’ table based on the memory actually
required by each glyph. The calculations take a while, depending on the font
size and the complexity of the hinting, but they reduce the memory requirements
for the font.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Be sure to recalculate the ‘maxp’ table before you prepare the font for
shipping, which strips out private tables needed for this calculation (see
“Preparing to Ship Your Font”).</p>
