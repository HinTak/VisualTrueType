<h1><a name=wiqzut></a>Preparing the Main Window</h1>

<p>Before you create a delta or move, you need to set up the main window
correctly. Open the Display Options dialog and configure options as follows:</p>

<p>Set the Grid Fit option so that you can see the effects of your work at each
ppem size. Exceptions apply only to a particular grid-fitted ppem size.</p>

<p>Set the Pixels option so the pixels immediately show the results of the
exception.</p>

<p>Clear the Show Fewer Points option to display the off-curve points.
Exceptions apply only to on-curve and off-curve control points, not to pixels.
More control points mean more ways to tweak the outline, forcing the computer
to choose different pixels, adding and removing to correct the problem. </p>

<p>Set the Grid Lines and Pixel Centers options so you can see if the exception
extends the outline over a pixel center, causing Visual TrueType to turn a
particular pixel on or off.</p>
